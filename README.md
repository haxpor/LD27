## Theme
A cat falls down from the real physical world 490 m above the ground, **that means it would takes 10 seconds for the cat to reach the ground. 

There's a myth called Nine Live (see wiki http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Lives) as before it actually died in physical world it goes into a virtual world to find the way out and live again. And this is your mission to cleanly avoid all obstacles and go directly to the ground in 10 seconds. 

The catch is that the cat falls down from the space! Then you need to help it passes through each chunk of world! 

## Control
- W A S D for movement (for block movement) 
- Space to activate ghost trick (slow down time) + **Mouse drag** obstacles object in any direction to clear your path (3 chances to do this).

## Epic 2018 Update

It's been 5 years :
- Migrated from Web Player to WebGL + latest Unity 2018.2. Loads a lot faster.
- Reuploaded from dead Dropbox link to my own website.
- Title screen contains how to play.
- Movement code changed because iTween no longer works with RigidBody.
- Tighter cat collider.
- If you somehow goes from start to finish without dying you will see "PERFECT" (Require absurd amount of luck I know)
